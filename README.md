# JavaScript Web Projects

## Project 1: Interactive Page with JavaScript
I developed an interactive menu page using JavaScript. The page includes various JavaScript functions to modify HTML content and add CSS rules. Debugging was essential, and I utilized the 'Live Preview' extension in VS Code to see real-time changes.

## Project 2: Interactive Page with Event Listeners
For this project, I enhanced the interactive page by adding event listeners for user interactions. I incorporated click handlers, window load handlers, and used `let` for variable declarations. Debugging included fixing display issues for thank you messages and refining syntax errors.

## Project 3: Weather Outlook with Event Listeners
I created a creative version of a weather outlook page focusing on iPhones. This involved using radio buttons, checkboxes, and input fields. Debugging issues such as button functionality were resolved by using `console.log` and referencing MDN documentation and blogs for solutions.

## Project 4: Dice Roller using Objects, Arrays, and Loops
In this project, I developed an interactive dice-rolling page with custom functionalities like play, pause, and rewind. I implemented the `DiceSet` class and attached event listeners to control buttons, providing a seamless user experience.

## Project 5: Public Database Display with Callback Functions
I created an interactive page using the `ChiEmpQuery` class to access and display public database information. Features include sorting functionality and a well-formatted display of matching records. The project involved implementing sorting methods for arrays and handling user-specified options.

## Project 6: JavaScript-controlled Media Element
I developed a customized media player with JavaScript, featuring control buttons for play, pause, rate change, stop, and rewind. A dropdown menu allows users to jump to specific timestamps in the video. Event listeners ensure smooth functionality, and user feedback is displayed at the end of the video.

## Project 7: Archaeology Game with Object Methods
I extended the Archaeology game by adding a grid-based layout and improving user interaction. Variables track user attempts and successful digs, and a performance display updates based on progress. Event handlers trigger functions based on user input, enhancing the gaming experience.

## Project 8: Snazzy Quiz with jQuery
This project involved creating a quiz about the Golden State Warriors using jQuery. The quiz includes radio buttons and checkboxes, with visual feedback and summary assessments for user responses. Event handling and fade-in effects provide a dynamic user experience.

## Midterm Report
For the midterm report, I presented a significant JavaScript concept with an example from my projects. The report included context, purpose, and an explanation, highlighting the importance and application of the chosen concept.
